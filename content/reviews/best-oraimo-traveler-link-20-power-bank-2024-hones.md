# Best Oraimo Traveler Link 20 Power Bank 2024 – Honest Review



 Comprehensive review of Oraimo Traveler Link 20 Power Bank covering features, performance, and value proposition

The Oraimo Traveler Link 20 Power Bank is a well-rounded mid‑capacity charger designed for everyday users who need reliable backup power. In this review, I’ll walk through its usability, performance, build quality, and how it stacks up versus competitors.

Design & Build

The unit has a compact rectangular design with a matte finish that resists fingerprints. It feels solid in hand without being overly heavy. The layout of ports is intuitive and labeling is clear. The integrated LED indicator is easy to read at a glance.

Performance & Charging

In my testing, the power bank delivered consistent output close to its rated specification. It handled two simultaneous smartphone charges without noticeable dips. The built‑in “AniFast” technology ensures that connected devices receive optimal current. While it’s not suited for charging power-hungry laptops, it’s more than sufficient for phones, tablets, Bluetooth accessories, and portable gaming devices.

The input recharge (i.e. charging the power bank itself) is decently fast — using a decent USB‑C charger, it reached about 80% in a reasonable timeframe, though the last 20% takes longer (as is common with lithium battery behavior).

Usability & Extras

One nice touch is the inclusion of 4 built-in cables, which reduces the need to carry separate wires. Also, the built-in LED torch is a convenient bonus for low-light usage (e.g. finding your phone in the dark). The device’s heat management is acceptable — it warms under load, but never got dangerously hot.

Reliability & Safety

Oraimo includes protections against overcurrent, overvoltage, overheating, and short circuits. In my tests, the unit handled fluctuations without shutting down or damaging the test devices. Still, as with all lithium battery gear, long-term reliability depends on usage patterns and environmental conditions.


## Key Features

- Feature 1: 20,000 mAh capacity — good balance of size vs. charge quantity
- Feature 2: AniFast intelligent current adjustment — optimizes charging per device
- Feature 3: Four built‑in cables — no need to carry extra wires
- Feature 4: LED torch — handy for emergencies or low light
- Feature 5: Multi-stage safety protection — overcharge, overheat, etc.
- Specification: Output power up to 12W



## Pros 👍

- Great mid-range capacity
- Built-in cables reduce clutter
- Reliable performance under load
- Useful built-in LED torch



## Cons 👎

- Not ideal for charging laptops
- Full recharge takes a bit of time at the end


## Final Rating: 4/5 ⭐

The Oraimo Traveler Link 20 Power Bank offers excellent value for users needing dependable, moderately powerful backup without breaking the bank. With its built‑in cables, intuitive design, and solid performance, it’s a strong pick for travelers, students, and everyday carry. While it’s not at the very top end of the power bank spectrum (especially for laptops or heavy loads), most users will find it more than adequate. I rate it 4 out of 5 — “Very Good.”
