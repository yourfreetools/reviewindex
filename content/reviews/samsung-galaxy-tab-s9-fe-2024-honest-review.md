# Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE 2025 - Honest Review

![Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE 2025 - Honest Review](https://i0.wp.com/mynexttablet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-test.jpg)

Comprehensive review of Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE covering display, performance, stylus features, battery life, and value in 2025.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE is Samsung‚Äôs mid-range contender, offering many premium features at a lower price. It aims to be a balanced tablet for entertainment, productivity, and stylus use, without going full flagship.

Performance & Use Experience

For everyday tasks like browsing, streaming video, note-taking with the S Pen, and light multitasking, the Tab S9 FE behaves smoothly. Apps open quickly, transitions are decent, and Samsung‚Äôs One UI offers useful features like split-screen and desktop-style DeX mode.

However, when pushed‚Äîsuch as heavy gaming, demanding photo or video editing, or using lots of apps at once‚Äîthe tablet shows its limitations. The mid-range processor means it won‚Äôt compete with higher-end chips on performance or raw speed.

Display & Stylus Functionality

The screen is a 10.9-inch LCD with 90Hz refresh rate. While it‚Äôs not as sharp or contrasty as AMOLED panels, brightness is good enough for indoor and many outdoor situations, and motion feels fluid most of the time. Viewing angles are fine, though in very dim light or at extreme angles, the LCD nature becomes noticeable.

The S Pen included is a major plus. Writing and sketching feel natural; latency is low enough for note-taking, and the pressure sensitivity makes it usable for casual drawing. The magnetized attachment makes it easy to store.

Design, Build & Durability

Physically, the Tab S9 FE feels solid and well built. The body design has a premium touch, and IP68 rating gives added confidence against water and dust exposure‚Äîsomething many competitors in this price range lack. Stereo speakers deliver good sound, and the tablet is light enough to hold for longer sessions.

Battery Life & Charging

Battery capacity is strong. For standard usage‚Äîstreaming, media, browsing, note-taking‚Äîyou can expect it to last through a full day or more, with room to spare. Charging is supported up to 45W, but because the charger isn‚Äôt always included and the speed tapers as battery fills, it doesn‚Äôt feel like super-fast charging in practice.

Value for Money

For its asking price, the Tab S9 FE gives a compelling package. You get many features often reserved for more expensive tablets: water resistance, a stylus, solid speakers, and a good display. The compromises‚Äîprocessor performance, lower refresh rate, and LCD instead of OLED‚Äîare real, but acceptable if you don‚Äôt need top-tier performance.

## Pros üëç

- S Pen included, with good writing/sketching feel
- Durable build with IP68 resistance
- Solid battery life for full-day use
- Good display and speakers for media consumption
- Expandable storage options



## Cons üëé

- Processor not top-tier for heavy workloads or gaming
- LCD panel lacks the contrast and deep blacks of OLED
- Charging isn‚Äôt as fast as some competing tablets
- Some models may have lower RAM which affects multitasking


## Final Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE is a strong pick for users who want a capable Android tablet with stylus support, solid build, and useful extras like water resistance, without paying flagship prices. It won‚Äôt win in raw performance or display luxury, but for general media, schooling, reading, light productivity, and stylus work, it offers excellent value.

If your needs include heavy gaming, graphic design, or ultra-high refresh rate displays, you might want to consider more premium models. But for most users, especially students or content consumers, this is one of the best mid-range tablets available in 2024.
