It‚Äôs smaller than most smartphones, with a 3.9-inch AMOLED display, but that compact size is part of its charm. This phone feels refreshing in a market dominated by oversized screens.

Unlike its predecessor, the Light Phone II, which used e-ink, the Light Phone III introduces a black-and-white OLED display. This is a game changer. It‚Äôs sharper, smoother, and more responsive, making typing, navigation, and even checking maps much easier. The screen avoids bright colors and animations, helping keep distractions at bay.

It‚Äôs not built for gaming or heavy multitasking, but it handles calls, texts, navigation, and media playback smoothly.
