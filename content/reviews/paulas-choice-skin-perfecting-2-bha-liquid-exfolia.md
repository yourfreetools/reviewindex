# PaulaÃ¢ÂÂs Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant



> PaulaÃ¢ÂÂs Choice 2% BHA Liquid: unclogs pores, smooths texture, reduces breakouts, gentle exfoliant for clearer skin.

PaulaÃ¢ÂÂs Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant is a cult-favorite skincare product, but there are some important things people should know before using it. It contains salicylic acid (a beta hydroxy acid), which penetrates deeply into the pores to dissolve oil, dead skin, and buildup, making it effective for acne, blackheads, enlarged pores, and uneven texture. Because it is a chemical exfoliant, itÃ¢ÂÂs best to start slowlyÃ¢ÂÂ2 to 3 times per weekÃ¢ÂÂbefore building up to more frequent use, depending on how your skin tolerates it. Overuse can lead to dryness, redness, or irritation, especially if combined with other strong actives like retinol or vitamin C. Always follow up with a good moisturizer and daily sunscreen, as exfoliation makes skin more sensitive to the sun. The formula is fragrance-free and designed for most skin types, but people with very sensitive or dry skin may prefer something gentler. Patience is key: clearer, smoother skin usually appears after consistent use for several weeks.
