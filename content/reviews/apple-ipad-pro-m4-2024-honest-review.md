Comprehensive review of Apple iPad Pro M4 covering performance, display, design, battery life, and overall value for creators and professionals in 2024.

The Apple iPad Pro M4 is Apple‚Äôs most powerful tablet yet, designed for professionals, creatives, and anyone who wants a laptop-class device in a sleek tablet form. With the M4 chip, improved display technology, and enhanced accessories, it sets a new benchmark for what tablets can do.

Performance & Effectiveness

Powered by the Apple M4 chip, the iPad Pro delivers lightning-fast performance for everything from gaming to 4K video editing. Apps load instantly, multitasking is seamless, and even demanding creative workflows like 3D rendering or complex photo edits run without stutter. It‚Äôs clear Apple designed this for pro-level users who want desktop-grade power in a portable device.

Display & Design

The iPad Pro M4 features a stunning Ultra Retina XDR OLED display. Colors are vibrant, blacks are deep, and the screen gets bright enough for outdoor use. For artists, the ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate paired with the new Apple Pencil makes drawing and note-taking fluid and natural.

The design is thinner and lighter than before, making it highly portable while still feeling premium and durable. With slim bezels and a sleek aluminum build, it continues Apple‚Äôs tradition of minimal yet striking aesthetics.

Battery Life & Charging

Despite its raw power, the iPad Pro M4 easily lasts a full day of productivity, streaming, or creative work. Battery life varies depending on heavy workloads like video editing, but in general, it‚Äôs reliable. USB-C fast charging with Thunderbolt support ensures quick top-ups and excellent connectivity with external displays or drives.

Software & Features

Running iPadOS, the iPad Pro balances tablet simplicity with desktop-like power. Stage Manager improves multitasking, while features like Freeform, improved file management, and advanced creative apps make it a versatile tool. For those who add the Magic Keyboard, it can function like a laptop replacement.

Value for Money

The iPad Pro M4 is expensive, especially when factoring in accessories like the Pencil and Magic Keyboard. However, for power users, digital artists, and professionals who want a single device for work and play, it delivers unmatched performance and longevity. Casual users may find the iPad Air or base iPad more cost-effective.
