Comprehensive review of The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + HA Serum covering features, performance, skincare benefits, and value proposition for 2024.

The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + HA Serum (formerly known as Buffet) has become one of the most sought-after skincare serums in 2024. Packed with multiple peptide complexes and hydrating hyaluronic acid, this serum promises to fight signs of aging, improve skin elasticity, and leave skin looking plump and refreshed. But does it really live up to the hype? Let‚Äôs dive into the details.

Performance & Effectiveness

On consistent use, the serum helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and early wrinkles. The lightweight, water-based formula absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy residue. Many users report smoother and firmer skin after 4‚Äì6 weeks of daily application.

The hydration boost from hyaluronic acid is noticeable, especially for dry or dehydrated skin. However, results vary‚Äîsome people may need to pair it with a good moisturizer for lasting hydration.

Texture & Application

The serum is lightweight with a slightly viscous texture. It spreads easily and layers well with other products in a skincare routine. Unlike heavier anti-aging creams, it feels breathable and comfortable on the skin, making it suitable for both day and night use.

Value for Money

One of The Ordinary‚Äôs strongest points is affordability. Compared to high-end peptide serums that cost 3‚Äì5x more, this product offers impressive results for a fraction of the price. The only drawback is that improvements are gradual, so patience is needed.
