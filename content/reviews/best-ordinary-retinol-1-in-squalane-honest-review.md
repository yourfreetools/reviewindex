 Comprehensive review of The Ordinary Retinol 1% in Squalane covering features, performance, and value proposition for skin aging and texture

The The Ordinary Retinol 1% in Squalane is an entry‚Äëlevel retinol serum that aims to deliver visible anti‚Äëaging benefits with minimal irritation. In this review, I go through how it performs, whether it‚Äôs worth the price, and who it may be best suited for.

What It Is

Retinol is a derivative of vitamin A that's well known for helping with fine lines, improving skin texture, boosting cell turnover, and fading discoloration. However, it can cause irritation, dryness, or redness, especially when first used. Squalane is an oil‚Äëlike emollient that helps with hydration and improving skin barrier function. By combining a 1% concentration of retinol in a squalane base, this product aims to balance efficacy with gentleness.

Performance & Results

On initial application (first 1‚Äë2 weeks), expect some sensitivity: slight tingling or tightness is normal.

After ~4 weeks of regular use (2‚Äë3 times per week, increasing gradually), many users report finer texture, smoother skin, and fading of mild hyperpigmentation.

Doesn‚Äôt cause as much peeling or flaking as stronger retinol formulas, thanks to its gentler base.

Texture, Absorption & Feel

Lightweight oil/serum texture ‚Äî spreads well and absorbs reasonably fast.

Feels moisturizing rather than stripping; doesn‚Äôt leave a heavy greasy finish.

Under light moisturizer or mixed with other actives, it works well without clashing, although always patch test first.

Packaging & Safety

Comes in a dark bottle (usually amber or opaque‚Äëdropper) to protect retinol from light degradation.

Clear usage instructions: start slowly, use at night, apply sunscreen the next day.

Side effects are minimized if introduced gradually; people with sensitive skin still should be cautious.

Value & Price

Very affordable compared to many higher‚Äëend retinol serums.

Given its strength and formula, it delivers great value for those getting started with retinoids.


## Key Features

- Feature 1: 1% encapsulated retinol ‚Äî effective concentration without being ultra‚Äëhigh strength
- Feature 2: Delivered in squalane ‚Äî adds hydration and skin barrier support
- Feature 3: Gentle formula ‚Äî minimal fragrance, less risk of irritation compared to harsher retinols
- Feature 4: Dark‚Äëamber dropper bottle ‚Äî protects formula from light degradation
- Specification: 30 ml bottle



## Pros üëç

- Gentle yet effective for improving skin texture
- Hydrating base helps reduce dryness/irritation
- Affordable compared to many retinols
- Good packaging for product stability



## Cons üëé

- Takes time to see dramatic results
- Not enough for deep wrinkles or very sun‚Äëdamaged skin
- Initial sensitivity possible


## Final Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê

The Ordinary Retinol 1% in Squalane is an excellent beginner-friendly retinol product. It strikes a good balance between efficacy and tolerability, especially for those who want anti‚Äëaging benefits without the harsh side effects of stronger retinoids. If you‚Äôre new to retinol or have mildly aging skin and want smoothness and texture improvement, this is a strong pick. However, if you have very sensitive skin or need drastic results more quickly, you might later consider stepping up to a higher concentration (or using it in tandem with more potency under dermatologist guidance). Overall, I rate it 4 out of 5 ‚Äî ‚ÄúVery Good.‚Äù
