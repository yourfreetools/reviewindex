# iPhone 17 Series & iPhone Air 2025 â Honest Review

![iPhone 17 Series & iPhone Air 2025 â Honest Review](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/product/iphone/standard/Apple_iPhone-17-Pro-lineup_hero.jpg)

> Comprehensive review of Appleâs iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, and new iPhone Air â covering design, cameras, performance, battery, pros & cons, and others.

The Apple iPhone 17 series brings some of the biggest changes weâve seen in years. The highlight is the new iPhone Air, Appleâs thinnest phone ever at just ~5.6mm, while the Pro Max continues to push performance, display, and battery life.

ð¹ Design & Display

The iPhone Air is shockingly thin, light, and stylish, while still packing a 120Hz OLED display.

Pro and Pro Max feature larger, brighter screens with better anti-reflective coating.

ð¹ Performance

All models come with the A19 Pro chip, making multitasking, gaming, and video editing smoother than before. Heat management is better on the Pro Max, though the Air can get warm during heavy use.

ð¹ Cameras

Pro Max: Triple-lens system with 48MP telephoto offering up to 8Ã âoptical-qualityâ zoom.

iPhone Air: A single but sharp 48MP wide lens â great for everyday use, but less versatile than Pro models.
ð¹ Battery Life

Pro Max has industry-leading battery life, lasting longer than many Android flagships.

The Air is slimmer, so battery isnât as strong, but iOS 26âs adaptive power features help extend usage.

ð¹ Verdict

The iPhone 17 Pro Max is for power users and creators who need the best cameras, biggest display, and longest battery.
The iPhone Air is for those who want a super-thin, premium design without all the Pro features.

If you already own an iPhone 15 or 16, upgrading depends on your needs: photographers and heavy users will love the Pro models, while casual users might be fine holding onto older models.

Bottom line: Appleâs iPhone 17 lineup is sleek, powerful, and polished â but comes at a premium price.
